## 🚀 Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thetuantrinh/UWB-Radar-Hand-Pose-Estimation.git
cd UWB-Radar-Hand-Pose-Estimation
```

#### 🛠 Environment
The original project was developed on python 3.9.0. We encourage you to create the same python version for reproduce purposes by creating python3.9 with conda by the following script:
```bash
conda create --name HPE python==3.9
conda activate HPE
```
***Then install all required libraries:***
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 📚 Training

⚠️ **Important:** Please update the default dataset directory in `scripts/train_hpc.sh` to the absolute path of your dataset.

##### 1. Structure the project
Before running training scripts, first structure the project by executing:
```bash
bash scripts/structure_project.sh
```
##### 2. Launch training

You can modify training parameters directly in `scripts/train_hpc.sh` (they are passed to `train.py`),  
or simply start training with:

```bash
sbatch scripts/train_hpc.sh
```

#### 📈 Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the RadarNet model by running:

```bash
bash scripts/eval.sh
```

#### 📊 Tracking Training with Weights & Biases (Wandb)

[Wandb](https://wandb.ai) is a great tool for experiment tracking and visualization.  
Install with pip:
```bash
pip install wandb
``` 

#### ⚠️ Potential Problems (HPC without Internet)

If you're training on a machine without internet connection (e.g., an HPC compute node), Wandb will not work online.  
To fix this, run in **offline mode**:
```bash
wandb offline
```

After training, sync all locally saved Wandb logs to the cloud:
```bash
wandb sync your-local-wandb-log-folder/offline-run*
```
👉 Remeber to replace `your-local-wandb-log-folder` with the path to your actual Wandb logs directory.

## 🧪 The system was tested on: [AlmaLinux release 8.5 (Arctic Sphynx)](https://wiki.almalinux.org/release-notes/8.5.html)
